## Software Engineering 
It involves the application of engineering principles 
in designing, developing, maintaining, testing and evaluating
software. To ensure that high quality softwares are made that meets users needs,
is efficient, maintainable and reliable.

## Difference Between Software Engineering and Traditional Programing
The differnce is primarily in the approach;
while software engineeeing adopts a broader approach 
which involves collaboration, applying best engineering principles,
maintenability and overral best practice,
traditional programing basically involves writing code to solve a 
particular problem.


## Software Development Lifecycle
Software development lifecycle refers to a structured process used by 
software engineers to desing, develop test and deploy software products, so
as to deliver high quality software products that meets or surpasses the 
user's expectations within given time and budget.


The key phases of software development lifecycle involves:
1. planning:
    Objective: Determine the scope and purpose of the software project.
    Activities: Define project goals, perform feasibility studies, 
    estimate costs and resources, and create a project plan.
2. Requirements Analysis:
    Objective: Gather and document the software requirements from stakeholders.
    Activities: Conduct interviews, surveys, and meetings to understand user needs and 
    system requirements. Create detailed requirements documentation.
3. System Design:
   Objective: Define the software architecture and design the system components.
   Activities: Create system models, diagrams (like UML diagrams), and design specifications 
   that outline how the software will meet the requirements.
4. Implementation(coding):
   Objective: Convert the system design into executable code.
   Activities: Write and compile code, adhere to coding standards, 
   and perform unit testing to ensure individual components work as intended.
5. Testing:
   Objective: Verify that the software works as intended and is free of defects.
   Activities: Conduct various tests, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, 
   and acceptance testing. Identify and fix bugs.
6. Maintenance:
   Objective: Ensure the software continues to operate correctly and efficiently after deployment.
   Activities: Perform ongoing maintenance tasks such as bug fixing, performance optimization, updates, 
   and enhancements based on user feedback and changing requirements.

Differnce between Agile and Waterfall Models of Software Development Lifecycle
### Agile:
Emphasizes flexibility, customer collaboration, and iterative development.
Features short development cycles called sprints.
Popular methodologies include Scrum and Kanban.

### Waterfall:
Linear and sequential approach.
Each phase must be completed before the next begins.
Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements.
