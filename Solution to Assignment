## Software Engineering 
It involves the application of engineering principles 
in designing, developing, maintaining, testing and evaluating
software. To ensure that high quality softwares are made that meets users needs,
is efficient, maintainable and reliable.

## Difference Between Software Engineering and Traditional Programing
The differnce is primarily in the approach;
while software engineeeing adopts a broader approach 
which involves collaboration, applying best engineering principles,
maintenability and overral best practice,
traditional programing basically involves writing code to solve a 
particular problem.


## Software Development Lifecycle
Software development lifecycle refers to a structured process used by 
software engineers to desing, develop test and deploy software products, so
as to deliver high quality software products that meets or surpasses the 
user's expectations within given time and budget.


The key phases of software development lifecycle involves:
1. planning
2. Requirements Analysis 
3. System Design
4. Implementation(coding)
5. Testing
6. Maintenance 

Differnce between Agile and Waterfall Models of Software Development Lifecycle
### Agile:
Emphasizes flexibility, customer collaboration, and iterative development.
Features short development cycles called sprints.
Popular methodologies include Scrum and Kanban.

### Waterfall:
Linear and sequential approach.
Each phase must be completed before the next begins.
Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements.
